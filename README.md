I created a project called Foodmunch, which is a responsive restaurant website.
The idea was to build a simple and attractive site for a food delivery or restaurant business.
I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to design and style the website.
It has different sections like Home, Menu, Offers, Testimonials, and Contact Us.
The layout adjusts well to different screen sizes like mobiles, tablets, and desktops.
I used the Bootstrap grid system to make the site responsive and user-friendly.
There are buttons and links that give a feel of a working site, even though it's static.
I also added some animations and hover effects to make it look interactive.
The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, so itâ€™s easy to share and view online.
This project helped me practice frontend skills and understand website structure better.
It also gave me hands-on experience with responsive design and using Bootstrap components.
I focused on writing clean code and making the design simple and easy to navigate.
Overall, it was a good learning experience for improving my web development skills.
